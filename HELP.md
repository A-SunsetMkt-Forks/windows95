# Help & Commonly Asked Questions

## MS-DOS seems to mess up the screen
Hit `Alt + Enter` to make the command screen "Full Screen" (as far as Windows 95 is
concerned). This should restore the display from the garbled mess you see and allow
you to access the Command Prompt. Press Alt-Enter again to leave Full Screen and go
back to Window Mode. (Thanks to @DisplacedGamers for that wisdom)

## Windows 95 is stuck in a bad state

On the app's home screen, select "Settings" in the lower menu. Then, delete your
machine's state before starting it again - this time hopefully without issues.
