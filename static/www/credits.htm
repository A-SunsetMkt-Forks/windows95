          <h3>Emulation Engine</h3>
          <p>
            None of this would be possible without the people working on v86, in particular Fabian Hemmer aka copy.
            You can visit his website at <a href="http://copy.sh" target="_blank">copy.sh</a>. It also wouldn't be
            possible without the QEMU project. If you enjoy running old systems, you probably want QEMU - windows95
            is merely a toy, QEMU lets you actually run old systems in a stable manner.

          <h3>Electron</h3>
          <p>
            Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using web technologies. It's what powers windows95.
            You can visit the project's website at electronjs.org (in a modern browser, not in windows95).
