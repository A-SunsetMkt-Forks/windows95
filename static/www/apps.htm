          <p>I've installed a few apps and games for you to try out. Check out the Games folder on the desktop!</p>
          <p>If you want to try other games, I recommend trying to find them on the Internet Archive. On your host computer, visit https://archive.org, then find the "Classic PC Games" category. Once downloaded, you can import them into windows95 from <a href="http://my-computer">your host's Download folder</a>.</p>
